# Activity

## Directions
Look at the image below and create this webpage using HTML (don't worry about styles yet; just focus on putting the content on the page). Write your code in the `index.html` file which is located inside the `mockup_practice` folder.

**IMPORTANT** Make sure to check your work in the browser *as you write your code*.

>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
If you are inside the `mockup_practice` folder inside your terminal, using the command `open index.html` will open your application in your browser.

## Commit Your Work

1. Get used to committing your work!

>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
  - `git add .` to add all of the files in your current directory
  - `git commit -m "add a message"` to make a commit

## The Mockup

## The Resources
1. URL for image: http://blog.taxact.com/wp-content/uploads/Complete-Guide-to-Employee-Stock-Options-and-Tax-Reporting-Forms.jpg

2. For text to fill the paragraphs, use [a Lorem Ipsum generator](http://skateipsum.com/) (this is just my favorite of many that you can use, including Bacon Ipsum and Hipster Ipsum).

3. The links that you create do not have to go anywhere, but you should be able to click on them.

>:elephant: Reminder:<br>
Use a `href="#"` to make a "dummy" link.

## Hungry for More?

1. Create an `about.html` file which has similar content to the index.  

2. Create an "About" link in the `index.html` file that takes you to `about.html`.

3. Create a "Home" link in the `about.html` file that sends you to the `index.html` page.

4. Add a `style.css` file, link it, and use what you know about CSS from Fundamentals to start styling this website.
